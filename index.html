            <p>i started making this website at around 1:32pm on monday the 8th of july, 2019. the day before, i had been out with my boyfriend, and we had used a flip-a-coin website to decide where we would eat. at the same time, we both said, "I could make that."</p>
            <p>after making a flip-a-coin page in javascript, i decided to make a larger website as a whole to host any small projects i do in javascript.</p>
